This means that the internal data cannot be directly accessed or modified by code outside the class.

This ensures that the object's data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner, preventing accidental or unauthorized changes.\n",

Abstraction helps in reducing complexity and makes it easier to work with objects.\n",
